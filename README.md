# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

# Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

# What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

# GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

# Tasks
0. README, AUTHORS
Write a README.md:
description of the project
description of the command interpreter:
how to start it
how to use it
examples
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference Docker’s AUTHORS page
You should use branches and pull requests on GitHub - it will help you as team to organize your work

1. Be pycodestyle compliant!
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.

2. Unittests
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
